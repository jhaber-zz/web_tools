    "# Scrapy tutorial\n",
    "Author: Jaren Haber <br>\n",
    "Institution: UC Berkeley <br>\n",
    "Date: March 20, 2019 <br>\n",
    "Purpose: PS239T Guest lecture <br>\n",
    "Source credit: I borrow heavily from tutorials by [scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) (especially) and also [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-crawl-a-web-page-with-scrapy-and-python-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Web scraping, often called web crawling or web spidering, or “programatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data,” is a powerful tool for working with data on the web. With a web scraper, you can mine data about a set of products, get a large corpus of text or quantitative data to play around with, get data from a site without an official API, or just satisfy your own personal curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the fundamentals of the webscraping process as you explore [quotes.toscrape.com](quotes.toscrape.com), a scraping-friendly website that lists quotes from famous authors. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a fully functional Python web scraper that walks through a series of pages and extracts data from each page. The scraper will be easily expandable so you can tinker around with it and use it as a foundation for your own projects scraping data from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping has several steps:\n",
    "- find web pages and download them (called *web-crawling*)\n",
    "- extract information from these pages (usually with CSS or XPath)\n",
    "- store formatted results to disk\n",
    "\n",
    "All these steps can be implemented in a number of ways in many languages. You can build a scraper from scratch using low-level modules or libraries, but then you have to deal with some potential headaches as your scraper grows more complex. For example, you'll need to handle concurrency so you can crawl more than one page at a time. You'll probably want to figure out how to transform your scraped data into different formats like CSV, XML, or JSON. And you'll sometimes have to deal with sites that require specific settings and access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have better luck if you build your scraper on top of an existing library that handles those issues for you. For this tutorial, we're going to use Python and Scrapy to build our scraper. *Scrapy* is one of the most popular and powerful Python scraping libraries; it takes a \"batteries included\" approach to scraping, meaning that it handles a lot of the common functionality that all scrapers need so developers don't have to reinvent the wheel each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus here is on applying Scrapy--arguably the most useful, flexible current tool for web-scraping. You can also read more about the [basics of scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html), read about its [architecture](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html), or see [the FAQ](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html). And if you need a refresher on scraping with Beautiful Soup, here's a [good tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scrape-web-pages-with-beautiful-soup-and-python-3).\n",

    "## Storing the scraped data\n",
    "The simplest way to store the scraped data is by using Feed exports, with the following command:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That will generate an quotes.json file containing all scraped items, serialized in JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "For historic reasons, Scrapy appends to a given file instead of overwriting its contents. If you run this command twice without removing the file before the second time, you’ll end up with a long JSON file--actually, a broken JSON file, which cannot be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use other formats, like JSON Lines:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON Lines format is useful because it’s stream-like, you can easily append new records to it. It doesn’t have the same problem of JSON when you run twice. Also, as each record is a separate line, you can process big files without having to fit everything in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In small projects (like the one in this tutorial), that should be enough. However, if you want to perform more complex things with the scraped items, you can write an Item Pipeline. A placeholder file for Item Pipelines has been set up for you when the project is created, in `tutorial/pipelines.py`. Though you don’t need to implement any item pipelines if you just want to store the scraped items."
