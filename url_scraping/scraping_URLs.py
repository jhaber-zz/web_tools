"""This script uses two related functions to scrape the best URL from online sources: 
1. The Google Places API. See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places) for the Python wrapper and sample code, [Google Web Services](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/) for general documentation, and [here](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details) for details on Place Details requests.
2. The Google Search function (manually filtered). See [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/google) for source code and [here](http://pythonhosted.org/google/) for documentation.

To get an API key for the Google Places API (or Knowledge Graph API), go to the [Google API Console](http://code.google.com/apis/console).

To upgrade your quota limits, sign up for billing--it's free and raises your daily request quota from 1K to 150K (!!).

The code below doesn't use Google's Knowledge Graph (KG) Search API because this turns out NOT to reveal websites related to search results--despite these being displayed in the KG cards visible at right in a standard Google search. The KG API is only useful for scraping KG id, description, name, and other basic/ irrelevant info. To see examples of how the KG API constructs a search URL, etc., see [here](http://searchengineland.com/cool-tricks-hack-googles-knowledge-graph-results-featuring-donald-trump-268231).
 
Possibly useful note on debugging: An issue causing the GooglePlaces package to unnecessarily give a "ValueError" and stop was resolved in [July 2017](https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places/issues/59).
Other instances of this error may occur if Google Places API cannot identify a location as given. Dealing with this is a matter of proper Exception handling (which seems to be working fine below)."""

# ## Define core URL scraping function

def getURL(school_name, address, bad_sites_list): # manual_url
    
    '''This function finds the one best URL for a school using two methods:
    
    1. If a school with this name can be found within 20 km (to account for proximal relocations) in
    the Google Maps database (using the Google Places API), AND
    if this school has a website on record, then this website is returned.
    If no school is found, the school discovered has missing data in Google's database (latitude/longitude, 
    address, etc.), or the address on record is unreadable, this passes to method #2. 
    
    2. An automated Google search using the school's name + address. This is an essential backup plan to 
    Google Places API, because sometimes the address on record (courtesy of Dept. of Ed. and our tax dollars) is not 
    in Google's database. For example, look at: "3520 Central Pkwy Ste 143 Mezz, Cincinnati, OH 45223". 
    No wonder Google Maps can't find this. How could it intelligibly interpret "Mezz"?
    
    Whether using the first or second method, this function excludes URLs with any of the 62 bad_sites defined above, 
    e.g. trulia.com, greatschools.org, mapquest. It returns the number of excluded URLs (from either method) 
    and the first non-bad URL discovered.'''
